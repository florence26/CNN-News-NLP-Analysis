# CNN-News-NLP-Analysis

The Juypter Notebook file attempts to implement Natural Language Processing techniques on transcripts from CNN news. The goal is to integrate my research and knowledge of NLP to produce analytical results to compare the language used by the CNN news anchors' language before and after Biden's inauguration on January 20th 2021. In order to conduct this, transcripts from the following shows were extracted:

<ul>
  <li>Anderson Cooper 360&deg</li>
  <li>CNN Tonight</li>
  <li>Cuomo Prime Time</li>
  <li>Erin Burnett OutFront</li>
</ul>
